# Chapter Two: Designing Your Application (UI and UX)

```
* Brainstorming :)
* Wireframing (UI, UX, flow chart, etc.)
* Mocking up a prototype.
* Finalizing your designs
```

In this chapter, we will take a look at how you can plan for an application, create wireframes, mock up prototypes using _Inkscape_ and polish your designs for development. We will also take a look at how do icon design to fit in the elementary OS design principles. It usually tempting to skip this process and go on to code your application. However, planing-out your application before beginning to write code will save you a lot of time and will help you structure your code and architecture to give a better user and developer experience.

## Brainstorming

The first step in design an application involves some kind of brainstorming on the kind of application you want to build, the problem you application will solve, the target users, features needed in the application, etc. It is important that you plan for these things since there are several approaches a developer can take to develop an application. No single application can meet the requirements of all users so it is important that you choose a target group. Knowing your target group will help determine the features you would need to implement in your application.

A common saying by the elementary OS team is to build something that does one specific thing and does it very well. Remember that there is no need to build and application which has already been built. You could instead contribute to making and existing application better. ...
