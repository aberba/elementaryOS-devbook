# Preface

> ## Note
> This book is a work-in-progress and I'm currently doing a major overhaul for elementary OS Juno development. You can support my work on [My Patreon](https://patreon.com/aberba) or [Card Payment](https://rave.flutterwave.com/pay/aberbalawrewncekuzv). Your support will enable me put more time into it and make it more awesome for everyone.

[elementary OS](https://elementary.io) is a Linux distribution that has caught the attention of many Linux users, as well as, users of other non-Linux based operating systems. Part of this traction can be attributed to its polished design and simplicity delivering a very good user experience. A remarkable attractor for elementary OS users is the App Center with over a hundred fully native applications very well designed and developed for elementary OS. The App Center enables third-party developers to submit their applications for publishing. Apps get reviewed and published within the shortest possible time, mostly few days after submission. Developers have the option to provide their application under a pay-what-you-want model making it lucrative for those looking to earn some passive income or form a business around it.

This book takes a simplistic approach to help you develop an application for [elementary OS](https://elementary.io). The book is *not* meant to teach how to program in the `Vala` programming language nor is it meant to teach you `GTK+` GUI programming. All you will learn is how to use your existing knowledge in Vala and GTK+ to design and build your application for elementary OS.
