# elementary OS devbook

Welcome to an unofficial guide to help you develop your application for `elementary OS`. This guide is **NOT** meant to teach how to program in the `Vala` programming language nor is it meant to teach you `GTK+` GUI programming. All you will learn is how to use your existing knowledge in Vala and GTK+ to follow this guide to be able to design and build your app for [elementary OS](elementary.io).

More importantly, the language and information here are my own, and I do not represent any organization or `elementary LLC.` in anyway.

### Side Notes
* **Vala** is a computer programming language used mostly to develop GTK+ applications. It is also used to write libraries and APIs.
* **GTK+** is a toolkit for developing Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications. With GTK+, you can develop applications that has buttons, text inputs, labels, switches, images, etc. with which you can use to interact with the application.
* You can learn Vala by visiting [HERE](link.com) or GTK+ by visiting [Horace Abenga's website](http://www.abenga.com/postseries/introduction-to-gtk+-programming-using-vala/).
