# elementary OS devbook

Welcome to an unofficial guide to help you develop your application for `elementary OS`. This guide is **NOT** meant to teach how to program in the `Vala` programming language nor is it meant to teach you `GTK+` GUI programming. All you will learn is how to use your existing knowledge in Vala and GTK+ to design and build your application for [elementary OS](https://elementary.io).

Note that the language and information here are my own opinion, and I do not represent any organization or `elementary LLC.` in anyway.

> #### Side Notes

> - **Vala** is a computer programming language used mostly to develop GTK+ applications. It is also used to write libraries and APIs.
> - **GTK+** is a toolkit for developing Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications. With GTK+, you can develop applications that have buttons, text inputs, labels, switches, images, menu, etc.
> - You can learn Vala from the [Gnome's Vala Tutorial](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/Tutorial) or the [The Vala Manual - GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/chebizarro/the-vala-manual/details) and GTK+ from [Gnome's Vala GTK+ Tutorials](https://developer.gnome.org/gnome-devel-demos/stable/beginner.vala.html.en) or [Horace Abenga's website](http://www.abenga.com/postseries/introduction-to-gtk+-programming-using-vala/)
