# Chapter Three: Coding Your Application (Tutorials)

```
* Creating and structuring a project
* Diving into Vala and GTK+
* Using the Granite framework
* Using the cmake build system
* Developing sample applications
```

In this chapter, we will take a look at how create and structure a project for a new elementary OS application. We will also dive into some Vala and GTK+ demonstrations to learn the process involved in development. Moreover, we will take advantage of the Granite extension which provides some well designed re-usable widgets and APIs which makes developing applications quick and easy. Finally, we will use the [cmake build system](http://www.cmake.org/) to build and install the demonstrated application (along with icons and configuration files) for testing in your development environment.

After learning all those above, you will then learn to use those acquired skills to build sample applications. This will demonstrate some real work elementary OS application development challenges and how to get around them.
