# Chapter One: Introduction to Tools and Resources
    * Development tools and resources
    * Learning resources
    * Setting up your development environment

Developing apps for elementary OS is not much different from developing Gtk applications  for other linux distributions, espercially debian based  distributions. The minor differences have to do with the few set of elementary OS specific APIs which you could (should) utilize when targeting elementary OS.

In this chapter, we will take a look at some tools and resources available to developers. Note that this guide will in some cases reference resources for you to check-out on your own. All these resources are already in existences and this guide just point you to them as I come across any in during research. Be aware that I do **NOT** take responsibility to ensure these resources are always available to you. However, I could make changes to this guide as situations change.

## Development tools and resources
These are those resources that you may need when developing (coding, documenting, building, packaging, etc.) your application. Again, I do not take responsibility to ensure that these resources will always be available to you.
